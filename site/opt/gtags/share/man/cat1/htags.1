[1mNAME[0m
       htags - generate a hypertext from a set of source files

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mhtags [22m[-aDfFghInosTvw][-d [4mdbpath[24m][-m [4mname[24m][-t [4mtitle[24m][[4mdir[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mHtags  [22mgenerates  a  hypertext  from  a set of source files of C, Yacc,
       Java, PHP and assembly.

       In advance of using this command, you should execute  [1mgtags[22m(1)  in  the
       root  directory of a source project.  Then you can execute [1mhtags [22min the
       same place.  [1mHtags [22mmakes a directory named 'HTML', and puts a hypertext
       in it.  You can start browsing at 'HTML/index.html'.

       Since  [1mhtags  [22mgenerates a static hypertext as long as neither [1m-D [22mnor [1m-f[0m
       option is not specified, you can move it anywhere and browse it by  any
       browser  without  any HTTP server. If you use [1m-D [22mor [1m-f [22moption, you need
       to use HTTP  server.  Though  any  HTTP  server  is  available,  [1mhtags-[0m
       [1mserver[22m(1) is recommended.

       This  command has so many options.  If you are new to [1mhtags[22m, it is rec-
       ommended to use [1m--suggest [22moption.  With that option, [1mhtags [22mchooses pop-
       ular options on your behalf.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following options are available:

       [1m--auto-completion[22m[=[4mlimit[24m]
              Enable auto-completion facility for the input form.  If [4mlimit[24m is
              specified, number of candidates is limited to the value.  Please
              note this function requires javascript language in your browser.

       [1m-C[22m, [1m--directory [4m[22mdir[0m
              Change the directory before doing all the work including parame-

              Add a call tree by [1mcflow[22m(1). [4mcflowfile[24m must be posix format.  If
              you use GNU [1mcflow[22m, invoke the command at the project root direc-
              tory with the [1m--format=posix [22moption.  This option is deprecated;
              please use [1m--call-tree [22mor [1m--callee-tree [22minstead.

       [1m--call-tree [4m[22mcallfile[0m
              Add  a call tree by [1mcflow[22m(1); [4mcallfile[24m must be posix format.  If
              you use GNU [1mcflow[22m, invoke the command at the project root direc-
              tory with the [1m--format=posix [22moption.

       [1m--callee-tree [4m[22mcalleefile[0m
              Add  a callee tree by [1mcflow[22m(1); [4mcalleefile[24m must be posix format.

              rectory 'CVS' exists in the root directory of the  project,  the
              content  of  'CVS/Repository'  is used as the relative path from

              option decreases both the size and generation time of hypertext,
              you need to start up HTTP server.
