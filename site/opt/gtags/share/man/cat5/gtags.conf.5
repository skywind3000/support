[1mNAME[0m
       gtags.conf - configuration data for GNU Global

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       'gtags.conf'
       '~/.globalrc'

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       'gtags.conf' has configuration data for [1mglobal[22m(1), [1mgozilla[22m(1), [1mgtags[22m(1)
       and [1mhtags[22m(1). They look for the following files in this order, and read
       from the first one that exists and is readable.

       (1) --gtagsconf [4mfile[0m

       (2) $GTAGSCONF

       (3) [project root]/gtags.conf

       (4) [project root]/[objdir]/gtags.conf

       (5) $HOME/.globalrc

       (6) /etc/gtags.conf

       (7) [sysconfdir]/gtags.conf

       [sysconfdir]  is  '/usr/local/etc' by default; you can change it by the
       --sysconfdir option of the configure script. [objdir] is 'obj'  by  de-
       fault; you can change it by [1mGTAGSOBJDIR [22mor [1mMAKEOBJDIR[22m.

       Its  syntax  is  similar  to  [1mtermcap[22m(5) except for some extensions de-
       scribed later.  A file includes one or more records. You should  select
       a  record  using a label.  Default label is 'default'. If [1mGTAGSLABEL [22mis
       set, its value is used.  Please be aware the meaning  of  'default'  is
       different from that of [1mtermcap[22m(5).

       Lines  starting with '#' are ignored.  A record consists of one or more
       fields separated by ':' and ends with a newline.  The first field  must
       have  a  label  name. Each field of the rest has a variable definition.
       There are three types in those variables.

       Boolean: This type has no value; existence of variable means true  else
       false.

       Number: This type has a number value after '#'.

       String: This type has a string value after '='.
              Most variables are relevant to string type.

       If data includes ':' or newline, you need to quote it by '\'.  An empty
       field is permitted, but it doesn't make sense.

       When there is more than one definition, the previous  one  is  adopted.
       Exceptionally, all values of [1mskip[22m, [1mlangmap [22mand [1mgtags_parser [22mare adopted
       and connected respectively.

[1mVariable substitution[0m
       Variable substitution similar to [1msh[22m(1) is available.  You can refer  to
       any  string variable using '$' prefix. For example, the following [1mb [22mhas
       a value 'XYZ'.
       :a=Y:b=X${a}Z:

[1mIncluding another record[0m
       [1mTc [22mis a special variable; it reads in definitions  in  another  record.
       It is similar to the [1mtc [22mof [1mtermcap[22m(5).  Its syntax is as follows:
       [1mtc[22m=[4mlabel[24m[@[4mfile[24m]
       If only a [4mlabel[24m is given, [1mtc [22mis read from a record specified by the [4mla-[0m
       [4mbel[24m in the same file. If @[4mfile[24m is also given, [1mtc [22mis read from a  record
       specified  by the [4mlabel[24m in the specified [4mfile[24m.  [4mFile[24m should be an abso-
       lute path, and should not  include  variables.   Different  from  [1mterm-[0m
       [1mcap[22m(5), you can use [1mtc [22manytime anywhere.

[1mCONFIGURATION[0m
       About variables for each command, please see each manual.

       You  can  use the following environment variables as a string variable.
       If these variables are set then environment variables of the same  name
       are set before command execution.

       [1mGREP_COLORS[0m
       [1mGTAGSBLANKENCODE[0m

       [1mMAKEOBJDIRPREFIX[0m
       [1mTMPDIR[0m

       The  following  variables  are also available as a string variable.  By
       default, each of them has a  directory  path  given  by  the  configure
       script.
       [1mbindir[0m
       [1mdatadir[0m
       [1mlibdir[0m

       [1msysconfdir[0m

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       The  following  environment  variables affect the execution of the com-
       mands.

       [1mGTAGSCONF[0m
              If this variable is set, the value is used  as  a  configuration
              file.

       [1mGTAGSLABEL[0m
              If  this  variable  is  set, the value is used as a label of the
