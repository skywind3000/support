This is a port of GNU GLOBAL to MS-Windows (32-bit) systems.
GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across diverse
environments.  It supports C, Yacc, Java, PHP4 and assembly source code.

This README file describes how to install GLOBAL on MS-Windows systems:

    1. Unzip the file gloNNNwb.zip (where NNN is the version number)
       preserving the directory structure.  Add the resulting 'bin'
       directory to your PATH, or copy/move the files in it to a
       directory already on the PATH.

    2. If you need to use a custom configuration file, set the
       environment variable:

	GTAGSCONF=<INSTALLDIR>/share/gtags/gtags.conf

       A default gtags.conf is supplied, but not used.

    3. HTAGS may require the use of the above file (if 'c:/usr' exists, but
       you've installed elsewhere), in order to find the icons it uses.
       Add 'datadir' to it:

	htags:\
	 :datadir=<INSTALLDIR>/share:\
	 :script_alias...

       Note: use slashes and add a backslash before the drive colon.  E.g.:

	 :datadir=c\:/global/share:\

    4. The documentation is in the form of an Info file and man pages.
       If you have Info, this file can be added by:

	cd <INFODIR>
	copy <INSTALLDIR>\share\info
	install-info global.info dir

       This adds a "GLOBAL" entry to the "Development" section.

       If not, the file can be viewed by any text viewer.  The man
       pages are best viewed with LESS.
